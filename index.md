# Overview of the Sukkari Dataset

In this paper, we present our efforts to construct an open-source dataset of Sukkari dates that are sorted and graded based on market standards.
We chose Sukkari dates because of the complexity of their grading criteria and their widespread availability.
To enhance productivity, we developed a system that automates the data collection process, which is explained in Section 2.
This dataset comprises 14,000 images, each sorted into one of five categories, as detailed in Section 3. 
The long-term goal of this project is to commercialize a compact, low-cost machine that automates the sorting and classification of date fruits for small and medium-sized farmers. Section 4 elaborates on our efforts to achieve this objective using the current dataset.
