Date palm production in KSA has grown substantially in the last decade, and more is being
exported outside the kingdom. To keep up with this rising demand, the date palm industry needs technologies that improve the efficiency of production and post-harvesting processes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been implemented in various agricultural sectors to increase productivity; however, there is a significant lack of AI solutions designed explicitly for date fruits.

A crucial post-harvest procedure for fruits involves sorting and grading them by attributes such as color, size, moisture content, and skin quality. Currently, small to medium-scale farmers rely on manual sorting, which results in a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent and inaccurate. Automation would enhance sorting precision and ensure a higher level of grading consistency across various farms.
One major barrier is the lack of open-source datasets for graded and sorted date fruit images.
